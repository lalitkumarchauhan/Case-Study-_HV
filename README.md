Analysis Case Study for Customer Retention
The business team want to get an insight of how the customers can be retained and how the retention rate is 
dependent on various factors like age of the customer,
gross income, number of credit cards among total of six features
The customer rentention rate is to be gauged from the two activity levels of cx i.e. active to inactive and inactive 
to active, if more customers are turning from 
active to inactive, and what kind of cx profile are more prone, it can be inferred.

Although, we are more inclined from the business point of view that what kind of cxs became active from inactive state 
but we can make a sense of the analysis
by finding an optimal model as to what percentage of cxs remained attahced to the services, product or facility 
offered by the business doer company or it can be 
concluded by the finding the cxs profiles which have remained in active state after the finish of the semester, 
hence we will find the customers who were active
at the start of the six months and remained in the active state after six months window also.
